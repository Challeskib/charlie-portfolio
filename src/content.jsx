        I am currently studying system development in .NET in Varberg
        and have gained experience in several areas, including C#,
        Microsoft SQL, Web development with React and Agile system
        development in teams. I look forward to putting my knowledge
        into practice and gaining practical experience in a real-world
        environment. In my spare time, I work on my music project/own
        company Laevendel where I write music and perform on live
        stages. I also play violin in a folk music band called
        Hallandsfolk. Other interests are: Surfing/skating and the
        martial art Brazilian Jiu Jitsu which I hold dear.
